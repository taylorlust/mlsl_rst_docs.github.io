Intel速 Machine Learning Scaling Library is a library providing an efficient implementation of
communication patterns used in deep learning. Some of the library features include

- Built on top of MPI, allows for use of other communication libraries
- Optimized to drive scalability of communication patterns
- Works on various interconnects Intel速 Omni-Path Architecture, InfiniBand, and Ethernet
- Common API to support Deep Learning frameworks (Caffe, Theano, Torch, etc.)

The Intel速 MLSL package comprises the Intel MLSL Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Intel速 MPI
Library Runtime components.
This document provides usage instructions for Intel MLSL, and its configuration reference. For
installation instructions, system requirements, and other information, refer to the README file supplied
with the library
