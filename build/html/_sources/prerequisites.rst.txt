Before you start using the IntelÂ® MLSL, make sure to set up the library environment. Use the command:
``$ source <install_dir>/intel64/bin/mlslvars.sh``
This is sets up the environment both for the C/C++ and Python* bindings.
Here and below, ``<install_dir>`` is the Intel MLSL installation directory, which is ``/opt/intel/mlsl``
by default.
